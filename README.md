Object detection is an advanced form of image classification where a neural network predicts objects in an image and points them out in the form of bounding boxes. Object detection thus refers to the detection and localization of objects in an image that belong to a predefined set of classes. In this project I have used pretrained YOLO model to predict objects. I have used streamlit to deploy my project as an end to end to
app for global use.
